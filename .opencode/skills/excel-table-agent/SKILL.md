# Excel Table Agent

Use this skill when the user asks Excel to do real spreadsheet work from natural language, especially:

- organize or beautify a table
- calculate totals, averages, rankings, rates, commissions, KPIs, or custom formulas
- repair an incorrect formula or algorithm
- generate a chart from selected data
- transpose rows and columns
- clean duplicates, blanks, spaces, inconsistent text, or obvious data quality issues
- create a pivot table, summary table, or report sheet

## Operating Rules

1. First read the current Excel context: workbook, sheet, selection address, used range, headers, sample rows, data types, numeric columns, text columns, formula cells, blanks, duplicates, and candidate target area.
2. Prefer native JSON tools over VBA. Use `ExecuteVBA` only when registered tools cannot express the task.
3. If the user selected a range, treat it as the primary working range. If there is no selection, infer the current table from `UsedRange`.
4. Do not ask the user for data that the add-in can observe from Excel.
5. For write operations, produce a plan with target ranges and expected effects before acting when the task is medium or risky.
6. After each operation, observe the sheet state: changed range, formulas, chart count, row/column shape, or generated summary.
7. If execution fails, repair the tool parameters using the observation. Do not fall back to a long chat explanation unless execution is impossible.

## Tool Preferences

- Table formatting: `FormatRange`, `AutoFit`, `ConditionalFormat`
- Formula generation or repair: `ApplyFormula`
- Summary/statistics: `DataAnalysis`, `ApplyFormula`, `CreatePivotTable`
- Chart generation: `CreateChart` after selecting chart type from data shape
- Row/column transpose: `TransformData` with `operation=transpose`
- Cleaning: `CleanData`, `RemoveDuplicates`, `FindReplace`
- Report output: `GenerateReport`, `WriteData`, `CreateChart`

## Chart Selection Heuristics

- Trend over time: line chart
- Category comparison: column or bar chart
- Share of total with few categories: pie chart
- Relationship between two numeric columns: scatter chart
- Multiple numeric series by category: clustered column chart

## Formula Repair Heuristics

When asked to fix an algorithm or formula:

1. Inspect the source columns and the current formula if present.
2. Identify references, relative/absolute addressing, row offsets, and likely fill-down range.
3. Generate the corrected formula for the first data row.
4. Apply it to the target range with fill-down when appropriate.
5. Observe whether Excel reports formula errors such as `#VALUE!`, `#REF!`, `#N/A`, or empty results.
